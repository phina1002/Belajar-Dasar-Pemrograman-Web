          <h2>Profile</h2>
          <p>
            Hi, my name is Phina Putri Amalia, and I am a student majoring in Informatics Engineering. 
            Currently, I am enrolled in the Learning Path Cloud Computing independent study program at 
            Bangkit Academy. I have a strong interest in technology and informatics, and that is why I 
            chose to pursue this major. I believe that Cloud Computing is one of the most relevant and 
            innovative fields in today's technology world, and I am excited to continue learning and 
            developing my skills in it. In addition, I also enjoy collaborating with people who share 
            the same interests.

                I am an Aquarius who is often perceived as an ignorant person, but has a deep concern for 
                the people around me. My seemingly independent and often floating nature makes people sometimes 
                think that I don't care, when in fact I am very sensitive to the feelings and needs of others. 
                I prefer to speak and act with actions rather than empty words, and sometimes this can make me 
                seem distant. However, when someone needs support or advice, I'm always ready to listen carefully 
                and provide unconditional help. I may not always show my feelings openly, but my concern for the 
                well-being of those closest to me never fades.

                I am an INFJ on the MBTI test, which means I am an individual who tends to be introspective, 
                sensitive to the feelings of others, and has a deep understanding of emotions. I often feel 
                connected to others emotionally, and at times, my feelings can become a burden as I am very 
                sensitive to the feelings of others. However, my strong empathic nature also makes me a good 
                listener, and I am always willing to provide support and advice to my friends and family.</p>

          <h2>Favorite Kdrama</h2>
              <p>
                I am an enthusiastic K-Drama fan. For me, watching Korean dramas (K-Dramas) is a profound and 
                engrossing entertainment. I am mesmerized by the emotional narratives, complex characters, and 
                superb acting in every K-Drama episode I watch. K-dramas are not just entertainment, but also an 
                entry point into the rich and diverse Korean culture. When I watch, I feel connected to the characters, 
                almost as if I'm along for the ride. I enjoy discussing my favorite plots, characters, and moments with 
                friends who share the same interests, and we often share drama recommendations with each other. K-dramas 
                have become an important part of my life, and I always look forward to new dramas that will take me on a 
                journey of great emotions.

                  I'm completely hooked on this story, which is full of action, political intrigue, and characters full of 
                  surprises. Each episode brought me into the thrilling and entertaining world of the roles, especially the 
                  action scenes that really caught my attention. In addition, "Vagabond" has an intricate plot with puzzles 
                  to solve, which kept me guessing what would happen next. I also really admired the great acting of the cast, 
                  who made their characters come alive. "Vagabond" has brought a lot of emotion and suspense into my life, and 
                  I'm always excited to talk about it with my friends who are also following the series.

                  One series that really stole my heart was "Arthdal Chronicles." I felt emotionally connected to this epic 
                  story that combines fantasy and historical elements in a world filled with political intrigue and power.

                  world-building and culture that is so well told in this series. I always look forward to how the story develops 
                  and how the characters face difficult challenges. "Arthdal Chronicles" is not only entertainment, but also a work 
                  of art that inspires and arouses my curiosity about Korean culture and history. I enjoyed talking about the series 
                  with friends who shared similar interests and often shared theories about the plot. It was a truly immersive and 
                  unforgettable viewing experience for me.

                    The presence of a cat in my life brings me irreplaceable happiness and peace. When I go home, meeting my beloved cats is 
                    the moment I look forward to the most. I love sitting with them, grooming them, and even talking to them. They are loyal 
                    friends who are always there for me, even when the outside world feels so busy. Seeing them playing with toys or lying down 
                    quietly can always lift my mood. My cats are an integral part of my family, and I'm always looking for ways to make them happy 
                    and feel loved, just as they love me.

                    I am a big fan of the capybara, or as it is often called "masbro." While capybaras may not be common pets in most places, their 
                    charm cannot be ignored. Their relaxed and friendly nature has always fascinated me. I love spending time learning more about their 
                    lives and behavior. Seeing photos and videos of capybaras is always a highlight of my day, and I really admire the way they live 
                    peacefully in their groups. I also hope to one day visit places where capybaras live naturally to see them in their natural environment. 
                    To me, capybaras are an inspiring example of harmony and harmony in nature.
